/*
Insertion Sort is an elementary sorting algorithm that builds the final sorted array one item at a time.
It takes each element from the list and inserts it into its correct position in the already sorted part of the array.

Consider {12, 11, 13, 5, 6}

Loop for i = 1 (second element of the array) to 5 (size of the array)

i = 1 --> Since 11 is smaller than 12, move 12 and
          insert 11 before 12. {11, 12, 13, 5, 6}

i = 2 --> 13 will remain at its position as all elements
          in A[0...i-1] are smaller than 13. {11, 12, 13, 5, 6}

i = 3 --> 5 will move to the beginning and all other elements
          from 11 to 13 will move one position ahead of their
          current position. {5, 11, 12, 13, 6}

i = 4 --> 6 will move to position after 5, and elements from
          11 to 13 will move one position ahead of their
          current position. {5, 6, 11, 12, 13}


Again the above logic could be solved recursively:
    a) If array size is 1, return.
    b) Recur for (n-1) elements
    c) Insert last element at its correct position in sorted array

    function insertionSort(arr) {
         for (let i = 1; i < arr.length; i++) {
        // Store the current element
        let current = arr[i];
        let j = i - 1;

        // Shift elements of the sorted section to the right
        while (j >= 0 && arr[j] > current) {
            arr[j + 1] = arr[j];
            j--;
        }

        // Insert the current element at the correct position
        arr[j + 1] = current;
    }
}

O(n^2) time complexity
