5.Backtracking

Backtracking is a systematic way to try out different sequences or combinations by building the solution incrementally and undoing ("backtracking") the previous step when needed. Itâ€™s often used in combinatorial problems (e.g., permutations, combinations, subsets, path finding).



ðŸ§  Core Thinking Pattern:

Choose: Pick a candidate to be part of the solution.
Explore: Recursively explore further with the current choice.
Unchoose (Backtrack): Remove the choice and try the next option.

This gives us a decision tree â€” where we explore all paths and backtrack when a path is invalid or complete.
